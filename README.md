# tickets-api
To make an api to see tickets,locations and actors to see if there are any movies that you like playing near you and maybe if you like a certain actor/actress you can filter by them to see in which movies they are in and see if you would be interested in seeing that movie.

Made by Marko Eduard Tagoma and Henry Lehis
